        <p>Writing students at Eugene Lang College founded the <span class="publication">New School Free Press</span> in September 2007, parting ways with the university’s not-so-newsy zine-style publication, <span class="publication">InPrint</span>. The <span class="publication"> Free Press’s</span> first editorial board intended to “extend our coverage to include all of the divisions at The New School,” according to an editorial in its inaugural issue. </p>

        <p>It was founded before Eugene Lang College offered a journalism program. The students based their editorial guidelines off of large publications, “We would really just look at the <span class="publication">New York Times</span> and look at how they wrote stories,” Kevin Dugan, news editor of the <span class="publication">Free Press</span> in 2008, said. </p>

        <p>The <span class="publication">Free Press</span> Free Press functions similarly to a local newspaper, informing a small community of students, faculty, and individuals affiliated with the school, with information The New School may not directly provide. </p>

        <p>The <span class="publication">Free Press</span> goes through constant changes, as leadership on the editorial board changes each term. It has undergone an unusual evolution. While many publications have ended their print publications to switch to be online only, the <span class="publication">Free Press</span> did the opposite, committing to print regular issues in Spring 2018.
        </p>
        
        <p>“I think part of the reason as to why we went back to print was to have more visibility on campus. As the newspaper grew older it’s visibility decrease: it was bi-weekly and then it was monthly,” said Truman Ports, editor-in-chief. “I think having a print product and being physically visible on campus is what establishes us as a news publication for the university.”   
        </p>
        
        <p>
        A print-only publication for its first eight years, it shifted to digital in 2015.  While primarily digital, the publication released a series of special print issues centered around specific themes. For example, “The Talk,” focused on sex and gender. After the release of these special issues, the <span class="publication">Free Press’</span> editors found that print most effectively established an on-campus presence. 
        </p>
        

        <p>
        From 2008 to 2012, the <span class="publication">Free Press</span> distributed bi-weekly print issues, which ranged between 12 to 20 pages. Members of the editorial board would regularly write editorials, and would run reader-submitted responses as letters to the editor. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As of Spring 2018, stories are published in print and online. Editors work with faculty advisors to plan print issues to be reported, completed and distributed over a span of three weeks. Editors select stories for print, prioritizing the most important pieces, as well as taking into consideration in-progress stories that fit the print timeline.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Reporters are assigned draft deadlines for their stories by editors. Editors complete several rounds of edits before sending to faculty members for final edits, as well as making sure stories are accompanied with media such as illustrations, graphics, or photographs. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The <span class="publication">Free Press'</span> design team consists of a graphic designer or illustrator, an editorial designer, and a faculty member who advises them. They decide on the print layout, and any additional illustrations, and photographs. All pieces are eventually published online and posted on the newspaper’s social media channels on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The <span class="publication">Free Press</span> publishes stories online, on a rolling basis.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The shift to a news-oriented publication has led to coverage on, among other things: the push for unionization of adjunct faculties, the tenures of President David Van Zandt and Bob Kerrey, Occupy New School, sexual assault on campus, theft,  student unions, the university’s sustainable mission, changes to university policies, and student life.
        </p>

        “They [<span class="publication">InPrint</span>] weren’t doing hard news, really. We wanted something that could be taken more seriously by people in the neighborhood. We really wanted to be a part of the Village in a larger way than just focusing on what was happening at Lang,” said Elisabeth Garber-Paul, editor-in-chief of the Free Press from 2008-2009, in an interview with the <span class="publication">Free Press</span> in 2017. 
        </p>
        
        <p>The <span class="publication">Free Press</span> shares the challenges and mission of a national or metro news publication. Without a central publication giving voice to outspoken individuals and groups within the community, there would be no one to hold those in power to account. </p>
        
        <p>
        The <span class="publication">Free Press</span> is offered as a course. Each semester, a new group of reporters join the paper. Students are graded for the work completed (or not) during the semester. The editorial board, made up of students who have served on the paper for multiple semesters, leads the newspaper each term. Faculty members supervise editorial board decisions and serve as the final editor for each published article. They also also lead workshops and lessons during class time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Those student reporters and editors have prioritized different aspects of the publication in different eras. Students on the <span class="publication">Free Press</span> have the opportunity to work in a problem and solution pattern, making the paper whatever they want it to be -- whether it’s the type of coverage, the tone of articles, layout design, ethical standards or prioritizing digital or print. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Since the Fall of 2007, editors of the news section have kept coverage serious, focusing on pressing and important stories. This heaviness was balanced out with a looser arts & culture section and opinion section. As always, the back page repeats with a photo story.
